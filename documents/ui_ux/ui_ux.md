# UI/UX Design

## Why

Some projects have user interfaces that are designed and developed by the UI programmers. This can work fine but it often has the following disadvantages:

1. The UI design that fails to capture user interest (programmers are not trained in design)
1. The UI design changes over time (programmers usually do not create a full plan of the UI/UX), requiring rework
1. The UI design does not do exactly what was required (without a fully functional 'mock-up', it is very difficult to communicate what the UI should actually do), again requiring rework

The following three points (corresponding to the above three points) explain why a UI/UX designer can improve a project's UI development process considerably:

1. UI/UX designers can create designs that capture user interest because they have been trained in this
1. UI/UX designers create a complete plan at the beginning that captures the full UI design
1. UI/UX designers plan using tools like figma and others, which allow the creation of detailed "mocks", "wireframes", etc which allow for an extremely detailed and concrete model of exactly what the UI is supposed to do. With proper explanation, these models can ensure all stakeholders in the UI development process know exactly what is supposed to be created.
